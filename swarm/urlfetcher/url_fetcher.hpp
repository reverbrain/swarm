 * \class url_fetcher
 * \brief The url_fetcher class provides convient API for fetching HTTP urls.
 *
 * Url fetcher provides API for performing GET and POST requests to remote HTTP servers
 * by methods get and post.
 *
 * Url fetcher uses provided class event_loop as an event loop for polling i/o operations.
 *
 * \attention Url fetcher's event loop must be executed exactly in one thread. Multithreading
 * is \b unsupported. To run url fetcher in different threads create different instances.
 *
 * Sometimes you may want to do synchronous requests to url fetcher. In this case you need to
 * use std::condition_variable to wait for request being processed.
 *
 * All methods except get and post are not thread safe.
